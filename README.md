# Session #1
We're in town for the Festival of the Swallowtail (butterfly).  Lars hasn't left the tannery in ages (involved with Mayor Deverin?)   Harpy queen is an upcoming production.  Famous actor will be playing the lead role.  Chapel burnt down a few years ago.  Desna (deity of aid fellow travelers, explore new places, express yourself through art and song, find what life has to offer).  We compete in the various events, we lose the rope pull.  Kristi does really well on the log roll.  I do above average but not great on the hammer toss.  Alex does exceptionally well at hide and seek.  I earned a composite longbow in the archery contest, and tied with Kristi in the swallow tail chase.

After the ceremony we hear screams and the sounds of strange creatures.  Laughter/singing of a shrill scratchy voices.  Three goblins pop out of a cart and we quickly dispatch them.  Two more goblins show up.   We kill all of them and I drag all of them into a pile in the area and separate them from their weapons.  We learn that they were in wagons that somebody brought into town.   The goblin dog has raised sores that ooze a viscous white fluid and he is covered in fleas.  When I hit him with my hammer, a disgusting amount of dander hits me and I (fail?) my fortitude check.   Kelly nature (21) checks the dog and learns that it has goblin pox and is transmissible through bites/inhaling dandruff/etc and can then be passed via breathing.  Goblins hate horses/dogs, love fire and have a series of superstitions about reading, they are nearly universally illiterate and fear/attempt to destroy written words.  

## Loot:
	* Composite Longbow
	* Stone Butterfly, when you twist the wings it glows 2x (magical)
	* 23 silver pieces
	* Several children
	* 3 shortbows
	* 3 dog slicers
